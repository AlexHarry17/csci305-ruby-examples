# Ruby Example Code

## Introduction
There are two directories containing the example code. The first is the `basic` directory which contains simple examples highlighting different aspects of ruby code. The second is the `advanced` directory which contains a few examples of more advanced functionality.

## Attribution
The examples in the basic directory came from Dr. Thomas W Bennet at Mississippi College and are a part of his collection of Lecture examples. All code has been documented to reflect this fact.

The examples in the advanced directory came from the book "Ruby by Example: Concepts and Code" written by Kevin C. Baird. Each example reflects this as well.
